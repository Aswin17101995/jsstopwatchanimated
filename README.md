# jsstopwatchanimated

This is a stopwatch implemented in vanilla JavaScript, featuring functionalities such as start, stop, and reset. The core logic resides in a setInterval function that executes every 10 milliseconds. To determine whether the stopwatch is in the start or pause state, a boolean variable is used. When set to true, the stopwatch begins counting seconds and minutes accordingly. For each passing second, six degrees are added to the rotation of the seconds pointer, ensuring it rotates appropriately
